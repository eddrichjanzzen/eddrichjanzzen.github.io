			<h3>About</h3>
				Hello! My name is Eddrich Janzzen Ang, but you can call me Janzzen. I am a software engineer who loves to code, read books, and explore new technologies. I also enjoy spending time around nature because it's a nice opportunity to unwind, destress, and clear my mind. 
				<br><br>

			<h3>Experience</h3>
				As a developer, I have experience working with different technology platforms such as Web Apps, Databases, and Cloud providers. I have experience using different application development frameworks such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/">Flask</a> and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/">.NET</a>. 
				
				<br><br>
				For frontend development, I have used frameworks such as <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React Native</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, and <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> to develop simple user interfaces. 

				<br><br>
				One aspect of software engineering I am very passionate about is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/">DevOps</a>. I enjoy building pipelines and automating tasks in order to speed up development and alleviate the bottle necks.
